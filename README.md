# UCB_cyber207_project1
Project 1 for Applied ML for Cyber Security (MICS @ UCB)

The goal of this project is to implement my own image recognition system for classifying handwritten digits. 

* Importing data MNIST data set.
* Testing the difference in k-Nearest Neighbors models using different k's
* Measuring affects on the model by changing training data set size
* Using data gathered from kNN model to train a Linear Regression model
* Pre-process data so that it may have a linear relationship appropriate for LR model
* Pre-process data using logit and logistic functions
* Employ Confusion Matrix to better understand the kNN model


This project explores the logic and math behind k-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression models by comparing 
and contrasting differences in hyper-parameters, data set size, and pre-processing data before fitting the 
model.
